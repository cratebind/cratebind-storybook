# Get started

Cratebind's Storybook is a reusable component library to help build UIs faster. The goal is to make simple but extensible React components that can be used in a variety of applications.

<!-- ## Install
SDS components are written in React, and its stories are written in [Component Story Format](https://medium.com/storybookjs/component-story-format-66f4c32366df). It requires Storybook version 5.2-beta and up.

Add SDS to your project.

`npm install --save @storybook/design-system` -->


<!-- ### **Use**

Import components you want into your UI

`import { Button, Badge } from ‘@storybook/design-system’;`

and use them like so

```
  const example = () => (
    <div>
      <Button appearance="primary" onClick={() => 0}>Do something</Button>
      <Badge onClick={this.clear}>Cool</Badge>
    </div>
  )
``` -->

### **Run and develop locally**
Clone the [SDS GitHub project](https://github.com/storybookjs/design-system) then start Storybook.
